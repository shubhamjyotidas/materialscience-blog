# Introduction

Satellite communication is an extremely important medium of communication nowadays. It provides long distance communication service to a wider region. Once the satellite is launched into space, all it needs is a ground station transceiver, which could transmit and receive the signals. Also, it doesn’t need regular maintenance.

## What do we know so far?

In satellite communication, we transmit data using high-frequency RF waves from different regions of the spectrum- Ka band, Ku band, C band etc. But for any digital communication signal, a decision must be made as to how the data that is to be transmitted will be applied to the RF carrier pulse i.e., which symbols get mapped to which frequency (in case of FSK) or which symbol gets mapped to which amplitude level (in case of ASK). For this, we take help of the Constellation diagram. A constellation diagram is a representation of the symbols in I-Q plane (In-phase and Quadrature-phase plane). As can be seen in the constellation diagram (fig. 3), the states closer to the origin or the inner states are lower power states and may not be distorted, while the outer states undergo more distortion.

n case of satellite communication, the data source can be any device which is capable of producing meaningful data in any form- analog or digital, the data can be a song, text, video, image etc. Ultimately any digital data is in binary format- 1’s and 0s.

The task of Transmitter is to encode the data, encrypt it and transmit the data through the channel. Just to give you an idea what encoding and encryption mean, “encoding is reducing the total number of bits that carry the same information” And how we exactly do that? By assigning a symbol to a block of 1’s and 0’s and transmitting that block. Encryption simply means scrambling the symbols in a way so that it can be securely transmitted without being accessed by anyone who is not authorized to.

## A Simple Satellite Transmission

A simple communication system basically consists of 5 main components- a data source which generates useful and meaningful information , a transmitter which transmits that information, a channel through which the information is relayed, a receiver which receives that information and an information sink or a user of that information (for which information was meant).
